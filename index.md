Hi, I am Vicente. I work as a Software/ML Engineer at 
[Rewe digital](https://www.rewe-digital.com/) 
in Cologne, Germany 
([profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vreyespue/)). 
My&nbsp;major interest is at the intersection of machine learning pipelines, 
big data analytics and cloud computing platforms.
I&nbsp;have 
[commits](https://github.com/vreyespue) and 
[answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6261650/vreyespue) 
related to these topics. I have also 
[papers](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=XnVpRFkAAAAJ) in the field 
of neural coding.

Thanks for visiting!
