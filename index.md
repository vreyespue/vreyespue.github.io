Hi, I am Vicente. I work as a Software/ML Engineer at
[Rewe digital](https://www.rewe-digital.com/)
([profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vreyespue/)).
My&nbsp;major interest is at the intersection of machine learning pipelines,
big data analytics and cloud computing platforms.
I&nbsp;have
[commits](https://github.com/vreyespue) and
[answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6261650/vreyespue)
related to&nbsp;these topics. I have also
[papers](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=XnVpRFkAAAAJ) in the fields
of machine learning and neural coding.

Thanks for visiting!
