Hi, I am Vicente. I work as a Software/ML Engineer at Rewe digital in Cologne, 
Germany. My major interest is at the intersection of machine learning pipelines, 
big data analytics and cloud computing platforms, with emphasis on recommender 
and natural language processing systems. I have also publications in 
neuroscience, specifically in the field of neural coding.
