Hi, I am Vicente. I work as a Software/ML Engineer at Rewe digital in Cologne, 
Germany. Currently my major interest is at the intersection of machine 
learning pipelines, big data analytics and cloud computing platforms. 
In this regard, my focus is to design and develop microservice architectures 
able to process in real time unstructured data in a robust and scalable manner, 
with emphasis on recommender and natural language processing systems. 

I have also publications in the field of Neuroscience. My major research 
interest has been to understanding how populations of neurons (so called 
neural ensembles) work together in order to represent and process sensory 
stimuli, thereby transforming them into decisions and actions (i.e. the 
neural coding field).
